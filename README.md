This repository has all the projects I did as a part of the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program.  
  
The projects are as follows:  
1.  **Project 1 - Solving Sudoku using AI**  
    i.  This involved programming in python to add two functionalities in a Sudoku agent  
        a.  Solving the naked twins problem  
        b.  Adding a diagonal sudoku functionality  
          
2.  **Project 2 - Build a game playing agent**  
    i.  The objective is to use adverserial search techniques to build a game playing agent for the game 'Isolation'.  
    ii. Perform heuristic analysis to find a good heuristic for the agent.

    )  

  
3.  **Project 3 - Create a domain independent Planner**  
    i.  Define problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain.    
    ii. Use search and automatically generated heuristics to solve problems.  
    iii.  Compare and contrast results based on various metrics like memory efficiency and search speed.

4.  **Project 4 - Build a Sign Language Reogniser** [Project Link](
      Udacity-Artificial-Intelligence-Nanodegree-Projects/Project_4_Build_A_Sign_Language_Recognizer/AIND-Recognizer-master/asl_recognizer.ipynb
    )  
    i.  The objective of this project is to build a word recogniser for positional data collected from American Sign Language (ASL) videos  
    ii. Use probabilistic model - Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to analyse the above data  
    iii.  Analysis using numpy and pandas in python
